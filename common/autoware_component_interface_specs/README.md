# autoware_component_interface_specs

This package defines the standardized component interface specifications for Autoware Core, ensuring consistent communication and interaction between various components in the Autoware autonomous driving stack.

## Purpose

The purpose of this package is to:

- Provide a single source of truth for component interface definitions
- Ensure consistency across different implementations
- Facilitate modular development and component interchangeability
- Document the communication protocols between Autoware Core components

## Structure

The package contains interface specifications for various components, including:

- Message definitions
- Service interfaces
- Action interfaces

## Usage

To use these interface specifications in your component:

1. Add this package as a dependency in your package.xml:

   ```xml
   <depend>autoware_component_interface_specs</depend>
   ```

2. Use the provided interfaces in your component code.

   ```cpp
   #include <autoware/component_interface_specs/localization.hpp>
   // Example: Creating a publisher using the interface specs
   using KinematicState = autoware::component_interface_specs::localization::KinematicState;
   rclcpp::Publisher<KinematicState::Message>::SharedPtr publisher_ =
   create_publisher<KinematicState::Message>(
   KinematicState::name,
   autoware::component_interface_specs::get_qos<KinematicState>());
   // Example: Creating a subscription using the interface specs
   auto subscriber_ = create_subscription<KinematicState::Message>(
   KinematicState::name,
   autoware::component_interface_specs::get_qos<KinematicState>(),
   std::bind(&YourClass::callback, this, std::placeholders::1));
   ```

## Versioning

Each domain namespace declares a semantic `Version` (`version.hpp`) and a `Specs` tuple listing every interface it owns. `0.x` denotes an unstable interface while the standard is stabilizing. Compatibility is decided on the `MAJOR` field only; `is_compatible` is the reference encoding of that rule for consumers that compile against this package. The deploy-time admission gate in `autoware_component_interface_admission` is a no-dependency leaf package, so it restates the same relation rather than calling `is_compatible` — the two must be changed together.

A domain declares its version, its `Specs` registry, and the ADL hook that `spec_version<Spec>()` resolves through in one macro, so the three cannot drift apart:

```cpp
namespace autoware::component_interface_specs::control
{
struct ControlCommand { /* ... */ };

AUTOWARE_COMPONENT_INTERFACE_SPECS_DEFINE_DOMAIN(0, 1, 0, ControlCommand)
}  // namespace autoware::component_interface_specs::control
```

## Quality of service

Topic specs carry the QoS their endpoints are created with (`depth`, `reliability`, `durability`); `get_qos<Spec>()` turns that into an `rclcpp::QoS`.

Services have a QoS profile too, but not a per-spec one. Every `create_service` and `create_client` call takes ROS 2's `rmw_qos_profile_services_default` — `KEEP_LAST(10)`, `RELIABLE`, `VOLATILE` — unmodified, so all services really do run under identical conditions. Rather than repeat that profile on every `ServiceSpec`, it is declared once as `service_qos` in `utils.hpp` and returned by `get_service_qos()`. `test_service_qos.cpp` asserts it still equals the RMW default it mirrors, so a change to that default surfaces as a test failure instead of as silent drift between the specs and the wire.

## C++ standard

The domain headers, `version.hpp` and `utils.hpp` are C++17, matching the `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17` that `autoware_package()` gives every Autoware target.

`concepts.hpp` needs C++20, because the standard library only exposes `<concepts>` in C++20 mode. A target that wants it opts in:

```cmake
target_compile_features(<target> PRIVATE cxx_std_20)
```

CMake raises that one target to `-std=c++20` and leaves every other target — and every C++17 consumer of the domain headers — on `-std=c++17`. This is what the package's own `generate_interface_manifest` and gtest targets do, and it builds on Humble / gcc-11 (Ubuntu 22.04) as well as on Jazzy. Both targets are `BUILD_TESTING`-gated, so a C++20 compile failure in either could never break the header-only package for its C++17 consumers.

Below C++20, `concepts.hpp` is an empty header rather than a hard error, so including it is always safe. Test `AUTOWARE_COMPONENT_INTERFACE_SPECS_HAS_CONCEPTS` before naming anything it declares.

## Interface manifest

`interface_manifest.json` is a machine-readable list of every registered interface: its domain, interface name, message or service type, kind, version, and the QoS its endpoints are created with. It is generated from the `Specs` tuples by the `generate_interface_manifest` tool and committed to the repository as the source of truth.

```json
{
  "domain": "control",
  "interface": "/control/command/control_cmd",
  "type": "autoware_control_msgs/msg/Control",
  "kind": "topic",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "qos": {
    "history": "keep_last",
    "depth": 1,
    "reliability": "reliable",
    "durability": "volatile"
  }
}
```

`reliability` and `durability` are the two axes ROS 2 checks when it decides whether a publisher and a subscription may talk at all, which is why a deploy-time gate needs them alongside the type and the version. Service entries carry the shared `service_qos` profile.

Regenerate the manifest by hand after changing any domain's specs, QoS or versions:

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install --packages-select autoware_component_interface_specs
./build/autoware_component_interface_specs/generate_interface_manifest \
  src/autoware_component_interface_specs/interface_manifest.json
```

The generator emits the same layout Prettier produces, so the committed file is stable across regenerations. Adjust the output path to match where the package lives in your workspace. `test_manifest.cpp` diffs the generator's output against the committed file, so a stale manifest fails the build rather than reaching consumers.

## Interface type-hash lockfile

`interface_type_hashes.jazzy.lock` records the [RIHS01 type hash](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep/pull/358) (the ROS Interface Hashing Standard, proposed in REP-2011) of every registered message and service type. A RIHS01 hash is a deterministic function of the full type description — transitively including every nested `.msg` include — so a change to a type's definition in _any_ repository changes its hash. This is the drift tripwire that complements the same-PR version bump: it catches a forgotten bump, and it is the only mechanism for the types owned by other repositories.

RIHS01 hashes exist only on ROS 2 Iron and newer, so the lockfile is Jazzy-specific and the generator's hash-emitting path is `#if __has_include(<rosidl_runtime_c/type_hash.h>)`-guarded — on Humble the tool is a no-op and the freshness test skips.

Regenerate it (Jazzy only) once you have established that the type change behind the new hash is intentional and reviewed — see "When the freshness gate fails" below before running this:

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install --packages-select autoware_component_interface_specs
./build/autoware_component_interface_specs/generate_type_hashes \
  src/autoware_component_interface_specs/interface_type_hashes.jazzy.lock
```

`test_type_hashes.cpp` diffs the generator's output against the committed file, but only when `AUTOWARE_CIS_CHECK_TYPE_HASHES` is set — this repo's own GitHub Actions sets it, while the ROS build farm's devel jobs do not, so a dependency-version skew on the build farm can never turn those jobs red. The always-on `covers_every_manifest_type` test still guarantees the lockfile and `interface_manifest.json` describe the same set of types.

### When the freshness gate fails

A red `committed_lockfile_is_up_to_date` means a registered type's definition changed relative to the last state a reviewer approved. **Regenerating the lockfile is the last step, not the first** — a bare refresh launders an unreviewed type change into the committed file and leaves the gate with nothing to catch. Decide which case you are in:

1. **You intentionally changed a registered type definition.** Bump the affected domain's version in its header, then regenerate the lockfile in the _same_ pull request. The version bump is what tells consumers the interface moved; the lockfile only records that it did.
2. **You did not touch any type definition.** Then the change arrived through a message-repository dependency — most often `autoware_msgs`, or a type owned by `geometry_msgs` / `nav_msgs` / `autoware_adapi_v1_msgs`. Find the upstream commit that moved the hash, decide whether that change is acceptable for this interface surface, and reference it in the pull request. If it is not acceptable, the fix belongs upstream, not here.

**For reviewers.** A commit that only refreshes `interface_type_hashes.jazzy.lock`, with no accompanying domain version bump and no reference to the upstream change that moved the hash, should be rejected — it is indistinguishable from silencing the gate. The lockfile's value is entirely in the review it forces; a hash diff nobody explained has bought nothing.

**Coverage limit.** A RIHS01 hash does **not** cover message constants or field default values, so an enum-only `.msg` edit or a default-value change does not change the hash. The lockfile is therefore a _structural/wire_ tripwire — the **secondary** check. The **primary** enforcement is a path-based gate that requires a domain version bump when a registered type's `.msg`/`.srv` changes in the same repository; it becomes fully effective once the message definitions and this package live together (tracked in autoware_msgs#169). Until then, the lockfile is the available mechanism for every row.
